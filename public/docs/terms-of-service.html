        <p>These Terms of Service ("Terms") govern your use of the services provided by VVVDigitals LLC ("VVVDigitals", "we", "us"). By purchasing services, booking or otherwise using our offerings, you ("Client") agree to these Terms. If you do not agree, do not use or purchase our services.</p>

        <p><strong>Refunds:</strong> Refunds are at our discretion and subject to the specific service. For one-off Starter packages, we will consider a partial refund if a requested deliverable is not provided as described and we cannot resolve the issue within a reasonable timeframe. For retainers and subscriptions, see the specific agreement.</p>
